## Notes

Challenges Encountered While Building the App

While building the Sea Monster Crowdfunding app, I encountered a few key challenges:

### 1. DOM Manipulation with Dynamic Data  
Managing the dynamic rendering of game cards based on filtered data (funded, unfunded, all) required careful use of functions like `filter()`, `forEach()`, and clearing previous content using `deleteChildElements`. Ensuring each update reflected accurately on the page without duplicating elements took some trial and error.

### 2. Ternary Operators for Dynamic Text  
Writing grammatically correct summary messages (e.g., "1 game remains" vs. "2 games remain") using the ternary operator required logical precision to ensure proper grammar and pluralization.

### 3. Sorting and Destructuring Data  
Sorting the games by funding amount and using destructuring to grab the top two funded games involved understanding how to work with arrays and maintain order after sorting.

### 4. Implementing Bonus Features  
Adding a real-time search bar and conditionally displaying a ‚ÄúFunded‚Äù badge introduced new layers of DOM manipulation. These features pushed me to think more deeply about how UI components respond to dynamic data.
